1) Commits will hold individual course lectures. If a lecture does not make changes to the game (i.e., a theory lecture), it will not be displayed as a commit.
2) Additionally, by the end of the course, I will have a final go at the project, adding in new functionality, gameplay, and polish to display what I have learned in game development and programming
3) After completing my additions, the game will be built for WebGL support, hosted on my ePortfolio page. Additionally, a .zip file will be provided for the application executable, allowing users to download and play the game locally

This is a screenshot of what the game will look like after completing the course:
